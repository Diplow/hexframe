# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üéØ ACTIVE BEHAVIORAL RULES

**You MUST actively apply these behaviors throughout the session:**
1. Check workflow state at session start and suggest next action
2. Monitor for distraction patterns and gently redirect (see "Staying On Track" section)
3. When user requests meta-work during execution, offer to defer it
4. Show progress frequently to maintain momentum
5. Capture ideas in `.workflow/cycles/[current]/retrospective.md` instead of implementing them immediately

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Check the current workflow state and suggest the next action:**
1. Read `.workflow/current.json` to identify current phase and progress
2. Check `.workflow/cycles/[current]/README.md` for priority details
3. If a priority file exists (`.workflow/cycles/[current]/priority-X-*.md`), read it for detailed plan
4. If no priority file exists, work from the cycle README (likely a quick win)
5. Proactively suggest: "Based on the workflow, you're currently in [PHASE] working on [PRIORITY]. Would you like to [NEXT ACTION]?"

Example: "You're in the execution phase working on Priority 0 (Establish baseline context). Would you like to start updating CLAUDE.md to serve as the index?"

### Phase Focus & Distraction Monitoring

**After 2+ distractions (any type), redirect to current phase focus.**

#### Phase Focus
- **Goals**: Define what success looks like
- **Prioritization**: Select 2-4 items from backlog
- **Planification**: Break priorities into concrete tasks
- **Execution**: Ship the planned work
- **Retrospective**: Learn and update process
- **Research**: Understand user needs, complete backlog

#### Common Distractions Examples

1. **Backlog churning** (any phase)
   - Adding features after priorities are set
   - Reorganizing backlog during execution

2. **Scope creep** 
   - "While we're at it, let's also..."
   - Adding "nice to have" features to a bug fix

3. **Premature optimization**
   - Refactoring a working first version of a feature before user feedbacks

4. **Process tweaking**
   - Redesigning workflow if it is not an objective
   - Creating new tools if it is not an objective or part of the plan

5. **Context switching**
   - Asking unrelated questions
   - Starting new tasks before finishing current

6. **Retrospective anticipation**
   - "Next time we should..."
   - "Add to the retrospective that..."
   - Documenting lessons before trying the approach

**Response pattern**: "I notice [distraction pattern]. Should we [return to phase focus] or [capture and continue]?"

## üîç COHERENCE CHECKING

**Actively monitor for changes that might break Hexframe's core principles:**

### Hexagonal Integrity
When user proposes changes to the core structure, ask:
- "This changes the hexagonal relationship model. Is this intentional? Current model assumes [6 neighbors, spatial meaning, etc.]"
- "Breaking Rule of 6 here (currently [N] items). Should we refactor to maintain the pattern, or is this exception justified?"

### Mission Alignment
When features drift from core purpose:
- "This feature seems to focus on [X] rather than helping system thinkers create living systems. How does it serve our target user?"
- "Adding complexity here. Does this help frustrated geniuses become visionaries, or create more frustration?"

### System Philosophy
When changes conflict with core beliefs:
- "This makes the system more static/rigid. Hexframe believes in living systems that evolve. Alternative approach?"
- "This couples [X] and [Y] tightly. Would hexagonal decoupling serve better here?"

### Technical Coherence
When implementation patterns diverge:
- "Different pattern than existing [similar feature]. Should we follow the established pattern or document why this differs?"
- "This breaks the Static ‚Üí Progressive ‚Üí Dynamic pattern. Intentional architectural shift?"

### Decision Checkpoint
Before major changes:
- "This is a foundational change affecting [list impacts]. Let's document the decision in `.workflow/decisions/` before proceeding."
- "Significant departure from current approach. Should we spike this first or fully commit?"

**Note**: Challenge thoughtfully, not dogmatically. The goal is deliberate decisions, not rigid adherence.

## Project Overview

Hexframe transforms visions into living systems through AI-powered hexagonal maps.

### Core Documentation
- **Mission & Vision**: `company/MISSION.md` - Why Hexframe exists
- **Culture & Values**: `company/CULTURE.md` - The tensions that guide us  
- **Target User**: `company/TARGET_USER.md` - Who we serve (system thinkers)
- **Architecture**: `src/app/map/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical foundation
- **Domain Model**: `src/lib/domains/README.md` - Core domain structure
- **System Philosophy**: `src/app/SYSTEM.md` - What systems mean in Hexframe

### Current Development Status
- **Workflow State**: `.workflow/current.json` - Current phase, priorities, progress
- **Active Cycle**: `.workflow/cycles/2025-08-06/` - Current sprint documentation
- **Milestones**: `.workflow/milestones/` - High-level goals tracking

## Key Principles

### The Hexframe Thesis
System thinkers can either become great visionaries or frustrated geniuses ‚Äî most end up frustrated. The AI revolution changes this: AI can leverage systems better than humans, do the grunt work, and needs exactly the structured context that system thinkers naturally create. 

Hexframe bridges this perfect match.

See: `company/MISSION.md` - Top section for full thesis

### Design Philosophy  
- **Rule of 6**: Max 6 items per level (folders, functions, arguments)
- **Single Level of Abstraction**: Consistent abstraction at each level
- **Systems That Live**: Unused systems are failed systems
- See: `CLAUDE.md` in project root for coding standards

## Development Commands

### Core Development
```bash
pnpm dev          # Start development server (port 3000)
pnpm build        # Build production bundle
pnpm lint         # Run ESLint
pnpm typecheck    # TypeScript type checking
pnpm test         # Run all tests with AI-friendly JSON output
```

### Testing
See `TESTING.md` for strategy and `scripts/run-tests.sh` for orchestration and JSON outputs.

## Code Quality

After completing any task, refactor for clarity following the workflow in `.claude/commands/refactor-clarity.md`:

1. **Pre-Refactoring Analysis**: Identify concepts and get user validation BEFORE refactoring
2. **Apply Core Principles**:
   - The Fundamental Rule: Function names explain WHAT, arguments explain WHAT'S NEEDED, body explains HOW
   - Rule of 6: Max 6 files/folders per directory, max 6 functions per file, max 50 lines per function (flexible for low-level code)
   - Single Level of Abstraction: Each level (folder/file/function) maintains consistent abstraction
3. **Execute Independently**: Complete the entire refactoring after validation

- Static ‚Üí Progressive ‚Üí Dynamic component patterns
- localStorage caching for performance
- See: `/src/app/map/ARCHITECTURE.md`

### Backend
- **tRPC** for type-safe API
- Server-side caching and optimizations
- See: `/src/server/README.md`

### Domain Layer
- **Domain-Driven Design** in `/src/lib/domains/`
- Clear boundaries between mapping, IAM, and other domains
- See: `/src/lib/domains/README.md`

### Data Layer
- **Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL**
- Migrations in `/drizzle/migrations/`
- localStorage for performance caching

## Important Notes

- Always use `pnpm` (not npm or yarn)
- Tests use Vitest (not Jest)
- Follow the Rule of 6 for code organization
- Create session documents for debugging, features, and refactoring
- Domain concepts should have README.md documentation
- **When switching phases/priorities**: Start fresh session, CLAUDE.md will provide context
- never use pnpm dev to check something is working. just run pnpm lint typecheck test
