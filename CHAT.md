# CHAT Panel Discussion

## Overview
This document captures the evolving discussion about the panel feature initially conceived as a "preview panel" but envisioned as something more ambitious - a chat interface that will transform how users interact with tiles and AI systems.

## Discussion History

### 2025-01-07 - Initial Vision Statement

**Context**: Moving beyond a simple preview panel to a more interactive chat-based interface.

**Key Points**:
- The panel is not just for reading tile content (preview)
- It will enable interactive conversations with tiles
- First step toward a larger vision of AI-powered tile interaction

## Design Considerations

### Naming Convention
- **Original**: Preview Panel
- **Evolved**: Chat Panel
- **Rationale**: Better reflects the interactive nature and future capabilities

### Progressive Enhancement Strategy

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Current Focus)
- Display tile content in dedicated panel
- Markdown rendering capability
- Basic selection and navigation
- Layout integration with existing map interface

#### Phase 2: Interactive Elements
- [To be discussed]

#### Phase 3: Full Chat Integration
- [To be discussed]

## Technical Implications

### Component Naming
- `/src/app/map/Chat/ChatPanel.tsx` (instead of PreviewPanel)
- Context and state management aligned with chat paradigm
- Future-proof architecture for conversation features

### State Management Considerations
```typescript
interface ChatState {
  selectedTileId: string | null;
  isPanelOpen: boolean;
  panelWidth: number;
  // Future additions:
  // conversationHistory?: Message[];
  // activeMode?: 'preview' | 'chat' | 'edit';
}
```

### Broader Vision: Systems as Interactive Experiences

**The Problem**: Systems are hard to grasp, especially other people's systems. While the hexagonal map conveys meaning through spatial arrangements, colors, and reliefs, it remains a static representation.

**The Solution**: The chat panel makes systems interactive and personal:
- **Personalization**: Connect other's systems with the user's own systems
- **Interaction**: Chat with the system itself, not just view it
- **Practical Application**: Navigate to a "goal clarification" system → chat with it to clarify your own goals

**Core Concept**: The chat is how Hexframe introduces and facilitates interaction with systems in a personal, conversational way.

### Examples of System Interactions

1. **Goal Clarification System**
   - User navigates to a goal clarification tile/system
   - Chat panel allows conversation with this system
   - System helps user clarify their own goals through dialogue

2. **Learning from Others' Systems**
   - Browse someone else's system map
   - Chat helps translate/connect concepts to user's context
   - Makes abstract spatial arrangements concrete and personal

3. **System Composition**
   - Chat guides users through combining systems
   - Explains relationships between tiles
   - Suggests connections to user's existing systems

## Technical Evolution Path

### Phase 1: Preview Foundation (Current)
- Display tile/system content
- Basic markdown rendering
- Establish panel layout and state management
- Name components as "Chat" from the start

### Phase 2: Context-Aware Display
- Show system context, not just tile content
- Display relationships to neighboring tiles
- Highlight system purpose and structure

### Phase 3: Interactive Chat
- Add message interface
- System responds to user queries
- Personalized guidance based on user's systems
- AI-powered system interpretation

## Architecture Decisions

### Why "Chat" from the Start?
- Sets correct mental model
- Avoids refactoring component names later
- Prepares codebase for interactive features
- Aligns with the vision of systems as conversational partners

### State Structure Evolution
```typescript
// Phase 1 (Current)
interface ChatState {
  selectedTileId: string | null;
  selectedSystemId?: string | null; // Already thinking in systems
  isPanelOpen: boolean;
  panelWidth: number;
}

// Future phases will add:
// - conversationHistory
// - userContext (their systems)
// - interactionMode
```

## Design Principles Deep Dive

### Core Design Principles

#### 1. Conversational Nature
- **Feel**: Like chatting with someone knowledgeable about the system
- **Tone**: Natural, adaptive, helpful
- **Not**: Formal documentation or rigid Q&A

#### 2. Intent-Aware Interactions
The chat understands different user modes:
- **Building**: Creating their own systems
- **Browsing**: Exploring others' systems for inspiration
- **Learning**: Understanding how systems work
- **Curiosity**: Just exploring

**Implementation**: Chat could propose probable intentions:
```
"I see you're exploring the Goal Clarification system. Are you:
- Looking to clarify your own goals?
- Learning how this system works?
- Thinking of adapting it for your needs?
- Or something else?"
```

#### 3. Chat-Driven Onboarding
- New users are guided by conversation
- Progressive revelation of features
- Contextual learning through dialogue

#### 4. AI Flexibility
- **Default**: Hexframe provides optimized prompts/systems
- **Customizable**: Users can modify or replace AI behavior
- **Key Insight**: Systems are more sophisticated than prompts - they orchestrate multiple AIs with specialized contexts

#### 5. Hexframe-as-System Example
The Hexframe codebase itself as a documented system:
- **What**: Project overview, page structure (Canvas, Toolbox, Chat, Hierarchy)
- **Perspectives**: Design view, security view, product view
- **Use Case**: Discussing new features while seeing the actual implementation
- **Meta**: Using systems to code with AI - maintaining architectural mental models

#### 6. Rich Interactions Beyond Text
- **Primary**: Natural language conversation
- **Enhanced**: Specialized widgets for specific actions
- **Example**: Drag-and-drop interface when comparing systems
  - "Show me parts of my system that could connect here"
  - Visual bridge between browsed and owned systems

### Emerging Design Patterns

1. **Contextual Adaptation**
   - Chat behavior changes based on user intent
   - Different "lenses" for viewing systems
   - Personalization based on user's own systems

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Start simple, reveal complexity through conversation
   - Widgets appear when relevant
   - Advanced features unlock through natural exploration

3. **System-Aware AI**
   - Not just GPT with a prompt
   - Orchestrated AI systems with specialized knowledge
   - Can be modified/extended by users

## Brainstorming Session Insights

### 1. Systems Evolution: From Markdown to AI Orchestration

**Current State**: Different perspectives as markdown files
- `/src/app/DESIGN.md` - Design philosophy
- `/src/app/map/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture
- Each file represents a lens/perspective on the system

**Growth Path**:
1. **Single Prompt** → Basic AI perspective
2. **Multiple Files** → Richer context
3. **Specialized Agents** → Domain experts
   - Tailwind expert
   - Inspiration expert (knows solutions that inspire Hexframe)
   - Design system expert
4. **Orchestrated Systems** → Meta-agents that know when to consult others

**Example**: A custom agent with a prompt and a map that knows when to consult other systems before answering the user.

### 2. Intent Detection Heuristics

**Behavioral Patterns** → **Inferred Intent**:
- Rapid clicking through tiles → Browsing/exploring
- Staying on one tile longer → Deep dive/learning
- Coming from user's own system → Comparing/adapting
- Following a specific path → Goal-oriented navigation

**Implementation**: Test and refine heuristics based on actual user behavior.

### 3. Widget Ecosystem Development

**Build as Needed**: Widgets emerge from user needs
- **Search Widget**: 
  - User describes what they're looking for
  - Chat generates search with prefilled tags
  - Display filterable list of matching systems
  - Enable browsing directly from chat

**Future Widgets** (organic growth):
- System comparison tables
- Interactive system builders
- Visualization tools
- Connection mappers

### 4. Multiple Tutorial Paths

**Different "Ways" for Different Users**:
1. **Developer-Oriented**: "Build your development workflow system"
2. **AI Coach**: "Create personalized coaching systems"
3. **Product Prioritization**: "Structure decision-making systems"
4. **Information Structuring**: "Organize knowledge systems"

**Key Insight**: Same tool, different entry points based on user context and goals.

### 5. Meta Example: Hexframe Documenting Itself

**The System**: Hexframe codebase as a living system
- Self-referential documentation
- Multiple perspectives on the same code
- User can see the actual implementation while discussing it

**Use Case**: "Let's design a new feature"
- Chat understands the current architecture
- Maintains consistency with design principles
- Challenges assumptions when needed
- Updates the system documentation as it evolves

## Design Implications

### Flexible AI Architecture
- Not hardcoded to specific models
- Systems as prompt orchestrators
- User-customizable AI behavior
- Default Hexframe-optimized prompts

### Progressive System Complexity
- Start simple (markdown + prompt)
- Grow organically (multiple agents)
- Enable orchestration (meta-systems)
- Maintain coherence across growth

### Context-Aware Tutorials
- Detect user background/intent
- Offer appropriate entry points
- Adapt language and examples
- Build on user's existing mental models

## Technical Considerations

### System Definition Evolution
```typescript
interface SystemDefinition {
  // Phase 1: Simple
  content: string; // Markdown
  prompt?: string; // AI instruction
  
  // Phase 2: Multi-file
  files?: SystemFile[];
  
  // Phase 3: Agents
  agents?: SystemAgent[];
  
  // Phase 4: Orchestration
  orchestrator?: OrchestratorConfig;
}
```

### Widget Registry
```typescript
interface ChatWidget {
  trigger: (context: ChatContext) => boolean;
  render: (props: WidgetProps) => ReactNode;
  actions: WidgetAction[];
}
```

## Chat Design Philosophy

### Core Decisions

#### 1. Hidden, Crafted Prompts
- **Decision**: Prompts are hidden from users and carefully crafted by Hexframe
- **Rationale**: The prompt is a key part of the Hexframe experience
- **Note**: May reconsider transparency later

#### 2. Authentic AI Persona
- **Foundation**: Based on genuine love for systems (founder's perspective)
- **Not**: Trying to make users forget it's AI
- **Not**: Impersonating the founder
- **Instead**: Transparent that the AI reflects systems and values the founder cares about

#### 3. Personal Touch with Boundaries
- **Examples**: May share personal domains (e.g., education as a parent)
- **Clarity**: Distinguish between expert knowledge and personal perspectives
- **Purpose**: Give "life" to the interaction without misleading users

#### 4. Named Personas with Distinct Roles
- **Multiple AIs**: Different names, personas, and contexts for different responsibilities
- **Example Personas**:
  - **The Explorer**: Enthusiastic, curious, open-minded, loves to learn
  - **The Architect**: Serious, organized, helps create concrete plans
  - **[Others to be defined based on needs]**

### Design Principles

#### Conviction-Based AI
- Grounded in Hexframe's mission to "make the world more deliberate"
- Reflects genuine beliefs about systems and their value
- Not neutral, but transparent about its perspective

#### Conversational Depth
- "Talking with AI isn't everyone's cup of tea"
- Works best when users know what they want
- Hexframe knows what it wants → interesting persona emerges

#### Progressive Revelation
- Start with enthusiastic exploration
- Transition to serious planning when appropriate
- Match persona to user's current needs

### Connection to Mission

The chat embodies Hexframe's core tensions:
- **Will ↔ Deliberation**: AI has conviction but engages in dialogue
- **Vision ↔ Execution**: Helps users move from ideas to concrete systems
- **Legitimacy ↔ Competence**: Balances enthusiasm with practical guidance

## Implementation Considerations

### Persona Switching
```typescript
interface ChatPersona {
  name: string;
  role: string;
  traits: string[];
  promptTemplate: string;
  triggerContext: (chat: ChatContext) => boolean;
}

// Example: Explorer → Architect transition
const shouldSwitchToArchitect = (context) => {
  return context.messages.length > 10 && 
         context.userIntent === 'planning' &&
         context.hasExploredSystem;
};
```

### Authentic Voice Guidelines
1. **Use "I" sparingly**: Only when sharing system examples
2. **Acknowledge AI nature**: "As an AI trained on these systems..."
3. **Show enthusiasm**: Genuine excitement about systems
4. **Admit limitations**: Clear about personal vs expert knowledge

## AI Orchestration Architecture

### System Composition Model

#### 1. Role System (Top Level)
```
        [Orchestrator]
       /              \
[Explorer]          [Architect]
```
- **Orchestrator**: Hidden interlocutor that decides who answers
- **Explorer**: Enthusiastic, curious role
- **Architect**: Structured, planning role
- Each tile contains a prompt defining the AI's role

#### 2. Persona System
```
        [Orchestrator]
       /              \
[Identity]          [Role]
```
- **Orchestrator**: Sophisticated prompt that modifies responses
- **Identity**: Defines personality traits, background
- **Role**: The functional behavior (what to answer)

#### 3. Composition
The systems compose hierarchically:
- Role System is the parent
- Each role (Explorer, Architect) is composed with a specific persona
- Result: A single AI system that embodies both role and identity

### Visual Representation
This orchestration is literally visible on Hexframe:
- Users could explore the AI's "system map"
- Each tile shows its prompt/purpose
- Spatial relationships show information flow

### Key Insights
1. **Self-Referential**: Hexframe uses its own system to orchestrate its AI
2. **Transparent Complexity**: Complex behavior from simple, visible components
3. **Composable**: Different personas can be mixed with different roles
4. **Extensible**: New roles/personas can be added as tiles

## Onboarding Flow: Progressive System Revelation

### Step 1: Conversation to System
- User has conversation about a Hexframe example
- AI helps identify user's intent
- Together they identify key tensions behind the intent
- Formalize a system with conviction about pursuing this intent
- **Learning**: Systems emerge from intentions and tensions

### Step 2: System Composition Demo
- AI suggests interacting with the newly created system
- Compose it with a persona (e.g., humorous one)
- User sees how "expertise prompt" + "persona prompt" = living system
- **Learning**: Systems can be composed and given personality

### Step 3: Meta Reveal
- Ask if user wants to explore a more complex system
- Reveal: "How about the system you're talking to right now?"
- User explores the AI orchestration system map
- **Learning**: Complex behaviors emerge from composed systems

### Step 4: Build Your Own
- Invite user to build their own systems
- Offer to chat with specialized Hexframe systems for guidance
- **Learning**: Hexframe IS about building and sharing system pieces

### Key Insight
The onboarding demonstrates Hexframe's core value:
- Not just telling users about systems
- Having them experience system creation, composition, and interaction
- Revealing that they've been interacting with such a system all along
- Natural transition to becoming system creators themselves

## Open Questions
1. What should we name the different personas?
2. How seamless should persona transitions be?
3. Should users eventually be able to see/modify prompts?
4. How to balance founder's perspective with user diversity?
5. What triggers persona switches naturally?
6. Will users be able to create their own orchestration systems? (YES - core feature)
7. How to visualize the active role/persona during conversation?
