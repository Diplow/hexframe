# Ubiquitous Language

A living glossary of terms used in the Hexframe project. This document establishes a shared vocabulary to ensure clear communication between developers, users, and AI systems.

## Core Structure

### Tile

A hexagonal unit representing a single concept, task, or function. Like a function in programming, a Tile has a clear name that conveys WHAT it does or WHAT it is about without revealing HOW.

### Frame

The result of expanding a Tile. A Frame consists of one CenterTile surrounded by up to 6 child Tiles, revealing HOW the original Tile accomplishes its purpose.

### CenterTile

A special Tile that serves as the center of a Frame. While visually identical to a regular Tile, expanding a CenterTile (not implemented yet) creates a new Map rather than adding to the current Generation.

### Generation

The relative distance from a Frame's center:

- Generation 0: The CenterTile of the current Frame
- Generation 1: Up to 6 direct children of the CenterTile
- Generation 2: All children of Generation 1 tiles
- And so on...

### Descendant

Any Tile that belongs to any Generation (1, 2, 3...) relative to a given Tile. All tiles in a Map except the CenterTile are descendants.

### Map

A view consisting of:

- One CenterTile (the origin)
- All Generations relative to that CenterTile
- Maintains abstraction boundaries (does NOT include internal expansions of CenterTiles)

### System

The complete hierarchical structure including:

- A root Map
- All nested Maps from expanded CenterTiles
- Full transparency without abstraction boundaries

## Spatial Concepts

### Opposite Tiles

Two Tiles positioned at maximum distance from each other in a Frame (e.g., NW â†” SE). Opposites typically represent tensions, dualities, or complementary aspects.

### Neighbor Tiles

Tiles adjacent to each other in a Frame. Neighbors share natural connections and often collaborate or share context.

### Direction

The six possible positions around a CenterTile in pointy-top hexagonal layout:

- 1 = NW (Northwest)
- 2 = NE (Northeast)
- 3 = E (East)
- 4 = SE (Southeast)
- 5 = SW (Southwest)
- 6 = W (West)

**Direction 0** has special meaning: it indicates composition. When a Tile has 0 in its Path, it means this position contains a composed System (result of drag-and-drop composition) rather than a simple Tile.

Best practice: Use string representations (NW, NE, etc.) in user interfaces and documentation for clarity, while using integers internally for Path calculations.

### Path

An array of direction integers representing a Tile's position in the hierarchy. Example: [1, 2, 3] means: from root, go to NW child, then its NE child, then its E child.

## Composition System

### Tool Tile

A Tile that wraps a specific capability (LLM, code execution, database access, etc.) with a defined interface of inputs and outputs.

### LLM Tile

A specific type of Tool Tile that provides access to a Large Language Model with configuration (API key, model selection, parameters).

### Context Tile

The most basic and commonly used Tile type, containing a title and description. Behavior when composed:
- With an LLM Tile: Provides the context (title + description) to the LLM
- With another Context Tile: Concatenates both contexts into a single combined context

This serves as the fundamental building block for creating knowledge structures and providing information to AI systems.

### Prompt Tile

A Tile containing a prompt template with parameters. When composed with an LLM Tool, creates a reusable AI component.

### Composition

The act of combining Tiles to create new functionality. Primary methods:

- **Drag to Center**: Creates a new System with composed behavior
- **Drag to Neighbor**: Augments a Tile with additional capabilities

### CollaborativeMap

A pre-designed template Map with:

- Multiple expanded Frames with empty CenterTiles
- Defined communication protocols between adjacent centers
- Awaits composition with LLM Tools to create multi-agent systems

## Actions

### Expand

Transform a Tile into a Frame, revealing its implementation through up to 6 child Tiles. Creates empty children if they don't exist yet.

### Collapse

Hide the children of a Frame, showing only the CenterTile. The children remain preserved for future expansion.

### Navigate

Change the viewing perspective by selecting a different Tile to serve as the Map's center.

## Constraints

### The Rule of 6

Each Frame can have at most 6 child Tiles. This constraint forces prioritization, maintains cognitive load, and ensures visual clarity.

### Abstraction Boundary

The separation between what belongs to the current Map (visible) and what belongs inside CenterTiles (hidden until navigated to).

## Philosophy

### Strategic Mapping

The intentional design of hierarchical structures to clarify thinking and enable understanding. Not about finding "natural" structures but creating ones that serve specific purposes.

### Progressive Refinement

The iterative process of expanding Tiles until sufficient context exists for execution (by human or AI).

### Visual Programming

Building complex systems through spatial arrangement and visual composition rather than traditional code.
