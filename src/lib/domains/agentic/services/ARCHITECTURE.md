# Agentic Services Architecture

## Overview

This subsystem implements the core agentic (AI agent) functionality for Hexframe, providing services that enable AI-powered interactions with the hexagonal map system.

## Key Components

### Context Building
- **ChatContextBuilder** - Builds conversation context
- **CanvasContextBuilder** - Builds spatial/visual context
- **ContextComposer** - Combines multiple context types

### AI Integration
- **AgenticService** - Main orchestrator for AI interactions
- **AgenticFactory** - Creates configured agentic instances
- **TokenizerService** - Manages tokenization

### Template System  
- **PromptTemplateService** - Manages AI prompt templates
- **ContextSerializer** - Converts context to AI-friendly formats

## Dependencies

- **Infrastructure**: Uses repositories for data access
- **Domain Objects**: Operates on agentic domain entities
- **External**: Integrates with LLM providers via repositories

## Boundaries

All services are exposed through index.ts. External access should go through this boundary to maintain architectural integrity.
