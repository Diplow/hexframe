# Handlers Subsystem Architecture

## Architectural Principles

### Single Responsibility
Each handler focuses on one aspect of cache operations:
- **Data**: Server communication and data loading
- **Navigation**: Center changes and item expansion
- **Mutation**: CRUD operations with optimistic updates
- **Ancestor**: Parent hierarchy loading

### Operation Composition
Handlers provide operation objects that encapsulate:
- Business logic validation
- State transitions
- Error handling  
- Side effect coordination

### State Coordination
All handlers work through the central state reducer:
- Dispatch actions to modify state
- Read current state for decision making
- Never directly mutate state

## Design Patterns

### Handler Factory Pattern
```typescript
export function createDataHandler(services, dispatch, getState): DataOperations {
  return {
    loadRegion: async (params) => { /* implementation */ },
    loadItemChildren: async (params) => { /* implementation */ }
  };
}
```

### Optimistic Updates (Mutation Handler)
1. Apply optimistic change to UI immediately
2. Send request to server
3. Rollback on error, confirm on success
4. Maintain rollback stack for complex scenarios

### Progressive Loading (Data Handler)  
1. Check cache for existing data
2. Load missing regions incrementally
3. Populate cache with normalized data
4. Update loading states appropriately

## Error Handling Strategy

### Graceful Degradation
- Failed loads show cached data with error indicators
- Network errors allow retry with exponential backoff
- Optimistic updates can be rolled back cleanly

### Error Boundaries
- Handler errors are caught and surfaced to UI
- State remains consistent even on handler failures
- Debug logging provides troubleshooting context

## Performance Considerations

### Debouncing and Throttling
- Navigation operations are debounced to prevent rapid state changes
- Loading operations are throttled to manage server load

### Memory Management
- Handlers don't hold references to large objects
- State cleanup happens through reducer actions
- Event listeners are properly disposed
