# Hexframe Mission: Make the World More Deliberate

## Core Tension: Legitimacy ↔ Competence

At the heart of a "deliberate world" lies a fundamental tension:

- **Legitimacy**: Ensuring we pursue the right goals - those that truly reflect what we want
- **Competence**: Being effective at achieving those goals

We need both! 
- Competence without legitimacy → efficiently reaching the wrong destinations
- Legitimacy without competence → the right goals remain forever unrealized

## The Six Children

### Legitimacy-Focused (Top)
1. **Express Wills** - Make our desires explicit and shareable
2. **Democratic Consensus** - Build collective agreement on goals  
3. **Validate Through Debate** - Test and refine our intentions

### Competence-Focused (Bottom)
4. **Design Systems** - Create effective architectures
5. **Execute with Tools** - Implement efficiently (AI, automation)
6. **Learn from Outcomes** - Improve through feedback

## The Deliberation Process

A truly deliberate world requires constant cycling between:
- Moving up: Ensuring our competent execution serves legitimate ends
- Moving down: Ensuring our legitimate goals get competently realized
- Spiraling: Each cycle refines both what we want and how we achieve it

## Starting with AI

AI serves as the perfect testing ground because:
- It demands explicit system design (competence)
- It raises immediate questions of intent and values (legitimacy)
- Success requires both: knowing what we want AND how to achieve it
