### Initial Problem Statement
We need a preview panel to read the content of the tiles. Then we can simplify the data display on tiles (just the title) and just display a markdown preview in the preview panel. We will later use this panel for more than just the preview but this is the start. The preview will take as much place as possible, while the toolbox, the map canvas and the hierarchy tiles will occupy the rest of the screen.
