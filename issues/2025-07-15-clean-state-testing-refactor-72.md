# Issue: Clean State Testing Refactor with Event Bus and Logging

**Date**: 2025-07-15
**Status**: In Progress
**Tags**: #refactor #testing #tech #enhancement #high
**GitHub Issue**: #72
**Branch**: issue-72-clean-state-testing-refactor

## Problem Statement
The codebase needs a comprehensive cleanup to achieve a clean state with all tests passing, no linting errors, and up-to-date documentation. Tests need to be reworked to properly utilize the recently built logging system and event bus system. Currently, components may have side effects on other components through various mechanisms, making testing difficult and behavior unpredictable.

## User Impact
- Developers experience flaky or failing tests that don't reflect actual behavior
- Test maintenance is difficult due to complex inter-component dependencies
- Code quality issues make it harder to add new features confidently
- Debugging is challenging without proper event flow visibility
- useEffect patterns may be causing unexpected behaviors

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `pnpm test:all` - observe failing tests
2. Run `pnpm lint:color` - observe linting errors
3. Review test files - notice lack of event bus mocking patterns
4. Check component implementations - find useEffects with side effects
5. Run E2E tests - no visibility into event flow

## Environment
- Development environment
- All developers affected
- Frequency: Ongoing development friction

## Technical Goals
- Rework tests to mock events and verify component reactions
- Ensure event bus is the only way for components to affect each other
- Create E2E tests that validate behavior via event bus and logs observation
- Remove problematic useEffects in favor of simpler solutions
- Fix all linting errors
- Update documentation to reflect new patterns

## Progress Update

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Fixed design system color violations in DebugPanel.tsx
2. ✅ Fixed Vite warning in trpc react.tsx  
3. ✅ Created EventBusProvider and EventBusContext for proper React integration
4. ✅ Added event bus custom matchers to test setup
5. ✅ Created integrated test utilities combining event bus with providers
6. ✅ Designed and implemented E2E test framework for event bus and log observation
7. ✅ Fixed linting errors (unused variables)
8. ✅ All color validation passing (pnpm lint:colors)

### Testing Infrastructure Created
- `/src/app/map/Context/event-bus-context.tsx` - React context for event bus
- `/src/test-utils/providers.tsx` - Integrated test providers with event bus support
- `/tests/e2e/utils/event-bus-observer.ts` - E2E test utilities for observing events/logs
- `/tests/e2e/map-navigation-events.spec.ts` - Example E2E tests with event observation
- `/tests/e2e/README.md` - Documentation for E2E testing patterns

### Current Test Status
- Unit tests: ✅ All passing (118 tests)
- Drag-and-drop tests: ✅ All passing (13 tests)  
- Storybook tests: ❌ 1 failure (loading-skeleton.stories.tsx renders correctly)
- E2E tests: Ready for implementation with new framework
- TypeScript: ✅ No errors
- ESLint: ✅ No errors or warnings
- Color validation: ✅ All passing

### Additional Fixes Completed
1. ✅ Fixed all TypeScript type errors
2. ✅ Fixed all ESLint errors and warnings
3. ✅ Updated all color classes to use semantic design system colors
4. ✅ Removed unused imports and variables
5. ✅ Added proper type declarations for custom Vitest matchers

### Remaining Tasks
1. Fix final Storybook test failure (loading-skeleton.stories.tsx)
2. Refactor existing tests to use event bus mocking patterns
3. Identify and remove problematic useEffects
4. Add more E2E tests using the new observation framework
