**Branch**: issue-1-toolbox-menu-ui-improvement

## Problem Statement
Tile buttons appearing on hover makes the general UI feel clunky. Users need a more intuitive and persistent way to interact with tiles using different tools/modes, with keyboard shortcuts for efficiency.

## User Impact
- Who is affected? All users interacting with the hexagonal map interface
- What can't they do? Cannot efficiently switch between different interaction modes without hover-based UI elements
- How critical is this to their workflow? Medium - affects core interaction patterns but doesn't block functionality
- Workarounds: Currently must hover over tiles to see action buttons

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the hexagonal map interface
2. Hover over any tile
3. Notice buttons appear on hover
4. Try to quickly perform actions on multiple tiles
5. Experience UI feeling clunky due to hover-based interactions

## Expected Behavior
- Persistent toolbox menu on the left side of the screen
- Click behavior changes based on selected tool
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick tool switching
- Three toggle states for the toolbox:
  1. Closed (minimized)
  2. Icons only with shortcuts and labels on hover
  3. Icons + labels + shortcuts displayed

## Environment
- Browser/OS: All browsers
- User role: All users
- Frequency: Always - core interaction pattern
