## 2025-06-22 11:00 - Context Analysis

*Added by @Diplow via /context command*

### Investigation Process
- Examined issue #56 documentation for dark mode toggle feature request
- Analyzed styling infrastructure (Tailwind CSS, CSS variables, shadcn/ui)
- Searched for existing theme management and dark mode implementation
- Investigated state management patterns for user preferences
- Reviewed UI component structure to identify toggle placement options
- Checked color system and CSS architecture

### Detailed Findings

**Styling Infrastructure**:
- Tailwind CSS with `darkMode: ["class"]` configuration
- Complete dark mode styles defined in globals.css using `.dark` selector
- OKLCH color space for modern color management
- CSS custom properties for theme variables
- shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
- `cn()` utility for class merging (clsx + tailwind-merge)

**Current Theme State**:
- Dark mode CSS fully defined but never activated
- No JavaScript logic to apply `.dark` class
- No theme provider or context
- No persistence mechanism for theme preference
- No system preference detection

**State Management Patterns**:
1. Direct localStorage (e.g., toolbox visibility)
2. Storage Service with dedicated user preference methods
3. React Context pattern (AuthContext, MappingUserProvider)
4. No existing user settings/preferences in database

**UI Architecture**:
- No header/navbar component exists
- Bottom-positioned controls (toolbox, map controls)
- Gradient backgrounds in map interface
- Footer only on static pages, not map view

### Synthesis
The application has a complete dark mode styling infrastructure that's never been activated. All the CSS groundwork is done - it just needs the JavaScript logic to:
1. Toggle the `.dark` class on the `<html>` element
2. Persist user preference in localStorage
3. Provide a UI control for toggling
4. Optionally detect system preference

The implementation would follow existing patterns:
- Use localStorage via Storage Service for persistence
- Create a Theme Context following auth pattern
- Place toggle in toolbox or create minimal header

### Changes Made to Issue File
- Added comprehensive Context section with 4 subsections
- Documented existing infrastructure (styling ready, logic missing)
- Identified key components and integration points
- Listed UI placement options for theme toggle
- Key insight: Dark mode CSS exists but needs activation logic
