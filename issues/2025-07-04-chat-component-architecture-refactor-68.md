**GitHub Issue**: #68
**Branch**: issue-68-chat-component-architecture-refactor

## Problem Statement
The new chat component has been vibe coded and needs architectural organization and structure. The current implementation lacks clear separation of concerns and consistent patterns, making it difficult to maintain and extend.

## User Impact
- Developers working on the chat feature may face confusion due to unclear code organization
- Future feature additions to chat will be harder to implement without clear architecture
- Potential for bugs due to unclear data flow and component responsibilities
- Code review and onboarding new developers becomes more challenging

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the chat component source files in `/src/app/map/Chat/`
2. Review the current implementation structure
3. Notice lack of clear architectural patterns and organization

## Environment
- Development environment
- All developers working on the codebase
- Frequency: Ongoing concern for maintainability
