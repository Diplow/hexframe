# Hexframe: Making the World More Deliberate

## Core Mission
Making the world more deliberate - more the result of what we want rather than circumstances that happen to us.

## The Six Facets of Deliberation

### 1. Express Wills (NW)
**Title**: Express Wills
**Description**: Capture and articulate what we want the world to become
**Key Points**:
- Transform vague desires into clear intentions
- Use visual systems to express complex wills
- Move from "what is" to "what we want"
- Make implicit goals explicit through hexagonal mapping

### 2. Legitimize Through Sharing (NE)
**Title**: Legitimize Through Sharing
**Description**: Defend and validate our wills by making them public and discussable
**Key Points**:
- Share systems openly for scrutiny
- Build legitimacy through transparency
- Allow others to understand your reasoning
- Create accountability through visibility

### 3. Test with AI First (E)
**Title**: Test with AI First
**Description**: Use AI as a sandbox for practicing deliberate system design
**Key Points**:
- AI systems as training ground for deliberation
- Practice making intentions explicit
- Learn from AI interaction patterns
- Build muscle memory for system design

### 4. Enable Democratic Deliberation (SE)
**Title**: Enable Democratic Deliberation
**Description**: Scale individual deliberation to collective decision-making
**Key Points**:
- From personal systems to shared governance
- Make collective wills actionable
- Enable group deliberation through visual tools
- Bridge individual and societal deliberation

### 5. Make Intentions Visible (SW)
**Title**: Make Intentions Visible
**Description**: Reveal the what, how, and why behind every system
**Key Points**:
- Systems explain their purpose
- Show priorities and tradeoffs
- Make decision logic transparent
- Enable understanding through visibility

### 6. Enrich Through Discussion (W)
**Title**: Enrich Through Discussion
**Description**: Improve and evolve wills through collective input
**Key Points**:
- Wills grow through interaction
- Incorporate diverse perspectives
- Refine through constructive critique
- Build better systems together

## The Deliberation Process

1. **Start with Expression**: Use Hexframe to express what you want
2. **Share for Legitimacy**: Make your systems public and defendable
3. **Test with AI**: Practice deliberation in AI sandbox environments
4. **Make Visible**: Ensure all intentions and tradeoffs are clear
5. **Discuss and Enrich**: Engage with others to improve
6. **Scale to Democracy**: Apply lessons to collective deliberation

## Why This Matters

The world becomes more deliberate when:
- Individual wills are clearly expressed
- Systems reveal their intentions
- Discussion enriches understanding
- AI serves as a practice ground
- Democratic processes become more transparent
- Collective decisions reflect collective wills

## Implementation in Hexframe

Each hexagonal system in Hexframe embodies these principles:
- **Center Tile**: The core will or intention
- **Surrounding Tiles**: The means, constraints, and considerations
- **Spatial Relationships**: Show tensions and synergies
- **Sharing Mechanism**: Enable public discussion
- **Evolution Path**: Track how systems improve through use
- **Democratic Features**: Enable group ownership and decision-making
