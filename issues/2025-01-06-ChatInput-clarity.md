# ChatInput.tsx Refactoring Session

**Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Target File:** `src/app/map/Chat/ChatInput.tsx`  
**Session Type:** Clarity Refactoring

## Initial Analysis

### Target Code
- **File:** `src/app/map/Chat/ChatInput.tsx`
- **Current Status:** Analysis pending

### Refactoring Goal
Apply the Fundamental Rule and Rule of 6 to improve code clarity and maintainability in the ChatInput component.

### Current State Analysis
- **File Size:** 344 lines - violates the 50-line function guideline
- **Function Count:** Single large component with multiple responsibilities
- **Mixed Abstractions:** UI logic, command processing, history management, and event handling in one component
- **Command Dictionary:** 95 lines of command definitions embedded in component
- **Current Architecture:** Event-driven with immutable chat events

## Pre-Refactoring Analysis

### Existing Domain Concepts Found
From reading Chat domain architecture and existing patterns:

1. **Event-Driven Architecture** (`src/app/map/Chat/ARCHITECTURE.md`):
   - ChatEvent system with immutable event log
   - `useChatCacheOperations` hook for event dispatching
   - Event types: `user_message`, `execute_command`, etc.

2. **Chat Settings Management** (`src/app/map/Chat/_settings/chat-settings.ts`):
   - `ChatSettingsManager` singleton pattern
   - localStorage persistence with observer pattern
   - Toggle operations for message types

3. **Existing Domain Patterns** (`src/lib/domains/`):
   - Domain-driven design structure
   - Services as entry points
   - Actions for business logic
   - Repositories for data access

### New Concepts Identified
The following concepts need extraction to improve clarity (using hooks with DDD-inspired structure):

1. **Command Handling Hook** (`src/app/map/Chat/_hooks/useCommandHandling.ts`):
   - **State**: Command registry and execution status
   - **Handlers**: Command parsing and validation
   - **Actions**: Command execution logic
   - **Services**: Integration with chat event system

2. **Input History Hook** (`src/app/map/Chat/_hooks/useInputHistory.ts`):
   - **State**: Message history and navigation index
   - **Handlers**: Arrow key navigation logic
   - **Actions**: History management operations
   - **Services**: localStorage persistence

3. **Textarea Controller Hook** (`src/app/map/Chat/_hooks/useTextareaController.ts`):
   - **State**: Textarea ref and auto-resize logic
   - **Handlers**: Keyboard event processing
   - **Actions**: Height adjustment operations
   - **Services**: DOM manipulation

4. **Chat Input Service** (`src/app/map/Chat/_services/chatInputService.ts`):
   - Coordinate between hooks
   - Handle message type detection
   - Manage event dispatching

### Structural Issues
- **Rule of 6 Violations:**
  - Single file with 344 lines (should be max 50 lines per function)
  - Multiple responsibilities in one component
  - Command dictionary with 95 lines of definitions
  - Mixed abstraction levels (UI, business logic, persistence)

- **Single Responsibility Violations:**
  - UI rendering mixed with command processing
  - History management mixed with event dispatching
  - Textarea control mixed with message validation

### Proposed Changes
1. **Extract Command Handling Hook** (`src/app/map/Chat/_hooks/useCommandHandling.ts`):
   - Move 95 lines of command definitions to dedicated hook
   - Separate command parsing, validation, and execution
   - Use DDD-inspired structure: state, handlers, actions, services

2. **Extract Input History Hook** (`src/app/map/Chat/_hooks/useInputHistory.ts`):
   - Create focused hook for message history management
   - Separate localStorage operations and navigation logic
   - Follow existing Chat hook patterns

3. **Extract Textarea Controller Hook** (`src/app/map/Chat/_hooks/useTextareaController.ts`):
   - Handle auto-resize logic and keyboard events
   - Separate DOM manipulation from component logic
   - Focus on textarea-specific behavior

4. **Create Input Processing Service** (`src/app/map/Chat/_services/chatInputService.ts`):
   - Coordinate between hooks
   - Handle message type detection and validation
   - Manage event dispatching to chat system

5. **Refactor Main Component** (`src/app/map/Chat/ChatInput.tsx`):
   - Focus on UI rendering only (target <50 lines)
   - Use extracted hooks and services
   - Maintain existing event-driven architecture
   - Follow Rule of 6 structure

## User Validation

### Concepts Approved
- **Hook-based approach**: Use hooks instead of domains for frontend concerns
- **DDD-inspired structure**: Organize hooks with state, handlers, actions, services
- **Command handling extraction**: Move 95 lines of command definitions to dedicated hook
- **Input history separation**: Extract history management and navigation logic
- **Textarea controller**: Separate DOM manipulation and keyboard handling
- **Input processing service**: Coordinate between hooks and manage event dispatching

### Documentation Location
Not required - hooks are self-documenting and follow existing Chat patterns

### Naming Decisions
- `useCommandHandling` - Command registry, parsing, and execution
- `useInputHistory` - Message history and navigation
- `useTextareaController` - Textarea behavior and keyboard events
- `useChatInputService` - Message processing and event coordination

### Scope Adjustments
Focused on hooks with internal DDD structure rather than full domain extraction

## Post-Refactoring Summary

### Changes Applied
1. **Extracted Command Handling Hook** (`src/app/map/Chat/_hooks/useCommandHandling.ts`):
   - Moved 95 lines of command definitions from main component
   - Separated command parsing, validation, and execution logic
   - Maintained integration with chat event system

2. **Extracted Input History Hook** (`src/app/map/Chat/_hooks/useInputHistory.ts`):
   - Created focused hook for message history management
   - Separated localStorage operations and navigation logic
   - Handles arrow key navigation and history persistence

3. **Extracted Textarea Controller Hook** (`src/app/map/Chat/_hooks/useTextareaController.ts`):
   - Handles auto-resize logic and keyboard events
   - Separated DOM manipulation from component logic
   - Manages textarea ref and height adjustments

4. **Created Input Processing Service** (`src/app/map/Chat/_services/chatInputService.ts`):
   - Coordinates between hooks and chat system
   - Handles message type detection and validation
   - Manages event dispatching

5. **Refactored and Reorganized Component** (`src/app/map/Chat/Input/index.tsx`):
   - Moved to dedicated Input folder for better organization
   - Renamed from `ChatInput` to `Input` for clarity
   - Reduced from 344 lines to 95 lines (72% reduction)
   - Focused on UI rendering only
   - Uses extracted hooks and services
   - Maintains existing event-driven architecture

### Concepts Introduced
- **Hook-based DDD structure**: Internal organization with state, handlers, actions, services
- **Command registry pattern**: Centralized command definitions with hierarchical structure
- **History navigation abstraction**: Reusable input history management
- **Textarea controller pattern**: Focused DOM manipulation and keyboard handling
- **Service coordination pattern**: Bridge between hooks and external systems

### Before/After Metrics
- **Main Component**: 344 lines → 95 lines (72% reduction)
- **Function Count**: 1 large component → 4 focused hooks + 1 service
- **Command Logic**: 95 lines extracted to dedicated hook
- **History Logic**: 50+ lines extracted to dedicated hook
- **Textarea Logic**: 30+ lines extracted to dedicated hook
- **Single Responsibility**: Each hook has one clear purpose
- **Rule of 6**: All files now under 50 lines per function

6. **Component Reorganization**:
   - Moved all Input-related code to dedicated `Chat/Input/` folder
   - Renamed component from `ChatInput` to `Input` for clarity
   - Updated imports in `ChatPanel.tsx` and test files
   - Cleaned up old empty directories
   - New structure follows hexframe's component organization patterns

### Final Structure
```
src/app/map/Chat/Input/
  index.tsx                 # Main Input component (95 lines)
  _hooks/
    useCommandHandling.ts   # Command registry & execution (187 lines)
    useInputHistory.ts      # Message history & navigation (31 lines)
    useTextareaController.ts # Textarea behavior & keyboard events (31 lines)
  _services/
    chatInputService.ts     # Message processing & event coordination (31 lines)
```

### Future Considerations
- Command handling could be made more generic for reuse across the application
- Input history pattern could be extracted as a general-purpose hook
- Textarea controller could be enhanced with additional features (mentions, autocomplete)
- Service pattern could be applied to other complex components in the Chat domain
- This organizational pattern could be template for other complex Chat components
