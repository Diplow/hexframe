### Initial Problem Statement
Tile buttons appearing on hover makes the general UI feels clunky. We should setup a "toolbox" menu on the left of the screen that would change the click behavior depending on what "tool" is selected. Keyboard shortcut should also be bound to this toolbox. The toolbox should have a toggle that switch behind 3 states: closed, icons only with shortcut and label on hover, and icons + label + shortcut displayed.
