# Priority 1: MCP Integration (Make Systems Alive Through AI)

## Context
Transform static hexagon maps into living systems by integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP). This is the core of the "Bringing Systems to Life" theme - enabling AI to actively work within and through the hexagonal structures.

## Core Vision
Systems that live through AI interaction:
- AI can read and understand hexagon contexts
- AI can execute actions based on system state
- AI can suggest system evolution paths
- AI can bridge between different hexagon contexts

## Key Components
1. **MCP Server Integration** - Connect to Claude through MCP protocol
2. **Context Bridge** - Convert hexagon state to AI-readable context
3. **Action Interface** - Allow AI to modify system state
4. **System Evolution** - AI-guided system growth and adaptation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] MCP server runs and connects to Claude
- [ ] Hexagon contexts are accessible to AI
- [ ] AI can perform basic system operations
- [ ] AI can suggest meaningful system improvements
- [ ] Integration feels natural within existing UX

## Impact
**Transformational** - This is what makes Hexframe unique. Without AI integration, it's just a mapping tool. With it, it becomes a living system that thinks and evolves.

## Dependencies
- Requires stable core functionality (Priority 0)
- Enables advanced sharing features (Priority 2)
- Provides data for usage statistics (Priority 3)

## Estimated Effort
**High** - New integration requiring protocol implementation, security considerations, and UX design for AI interactions.

## Implementation Notes
- Start with read-only context sharing
- Build secure action interface
- Design for extensible AI capabilities
- Consider offline mode implications
