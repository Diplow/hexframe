# Cycle 2: Bringing Systems to Life

**Theme**: Enable living systems through AI integration and sharing  
**Duration**: 2025-08-07 to 2025-08-21 (estimated)  
**Status**: Planification Phase

## Branching Strategy

Each priority will be implemented in its own feature branch from `develop`:
1. Create branch from `develop` for each priority
2. Merge to `develop` when priority is complete  
3. Create the pull request from `develop` to `main` after each priority to trigger CodeRabbit review and merge into main after addressing them.
4. This ensures clean history and proper code reviews

## Selected Priorities

### Priority 0: Foundation Cleanup âœ… COMPLETED
**Branch**: `priority-0-foundation-cleanup`
- Test output configuration for AI parsing
- CodeRabbit PR #95 feedback resolution
- Remove offline mode references
- Fix critical bugs (swap state, focus, widget close)
- **Estimated**: 1-2 days

### Priority 0.5: Document All Subsystems ðŸ”„ CURRENT
**Branch**: Various `docs/*-subsystem` branches
- Document all major subsystems for architectural clarity
- Create README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, interface.ts, dependencies.json for each
- Establish clear boundaries and dependencies
- **Estimated**: 2-3 days
- **Status**: 0/8 tasks completed

### Priority 1: Chat UX Enhancement
**Branch**: `priority-1-chat-ux-enhancement`
- Slack-inspired message layout improvements
- AI thinking feedback with streaming tokens
- Smooth Canvas scanning animations during AI processing
- Professional state transitions (yellowâ†’greenâ†’message)
- **Estimated**: 3-4 days

### Priority 2: MCP Integration
**Branch**: `priority-2-mcp-integration`
- Enable AI to access Hexframe systems
- Start Claude sessions that auto-call systems
- Foundation for "living systems" concept
- **Estimated**: 3-4 days (ambitious)

### Priority 3: Privacy Controls & Sharing
**Branch**: `priority-3-privacy-sharing`  
- Public/private tiles with AI context isolation
- Basic forking capability
- Server-side filtering for AI access
- **Estimated**: 2-3 days

### Priority 4: Usage Statistics Widget
**Branch**: `priority-4-usage-stats`
- Track MCP calls and chat interactions
- Display system usage metrics
- Foundation for Monitor value
- **Estimated**: 1-2 days

### Priority 5: Web Search Integration
**Branch**: `priority-5-web-search`
- Import external knowledge into systems
- Search and format via Hexframe
- Accelerate system creation
- **Estimated**: 2 days

## Total Estimated Effort
12-16 days of focused work

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All critical bugs fixed
- [ ] Chat UX provides professional, polished experience
- [ ] AI thinking process visible with smooth transitions
- [ ] MCP server functional (at least read-only)
- [ ] Users can share systems publicly
- [ ] Usage metrics visible
- [ ] Web content importable

## Key Risks
- MCP integration complexity might exceed estimates
- Privacy implementation needs careful security review
- Multiple priorities depend on P0 foundation work

## Current Status

**Phase**: Planification â†’ Execution (hybrid approach for Priority 0)
**Current Work**: Priority 0 - each task gets plan+implement immediately
**Branch Strategy**: Each P0 task gets its own branch, merged to develop when complete

## Next Steps
1. **Start with P0 Task 1**: Configure test output
   - Create branch `p0-test-output` from develop
   - Plan the task in detail
   - Implement immediately
   - Merge to develop
2. Continue through all P0 tasks sequentially
3. After P0 complete, proceed with normal planification for P1-P4
