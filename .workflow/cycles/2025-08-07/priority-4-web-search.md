# Priority 4: Web Search Integration

## Context
Import external knowledge directly into hexagon contexts, enriching systems with real-world information and keeping them connected to evolving knowledge.

## Core Features
1. **Search Integration** - Direct web search from hexagon contexts
2. **Knowledge Import** - Convert search results into hexagon content
3. **Source Tracking** - Maintain links to original sources
4. **Content Curation** - AI-assisted filtering and summarization

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can search the web from within hexagons
- [ ] Search results can be imported as hexagon content
- [ ] Sources are properly attributed and linked
- [ ] AI helps curate and summarize imported knowledge
- [ ] Integration feels natural within existing workflow

## Impact
**Medium** - Extends system capabilities beyond user knowledge, making systems more comprehensive and valuable. Bridges internal system thinking with external information.

## Dependencies
- Enhanced by MCP integration (Priority 1) for AI-powered curation
- Benefits from stable core functionality (Priority 0)
- Could leverage usage statistics (Priority 3) for search optimization

## Estimated Effort
**Medium** - Integration with search APIs, content processing, and UI for search workflow.

## Implementation Notes
- Start with simple search and import
- Design for multiple search sources
- Consider rate limiting and API costs
- Plan for AI-enhanced content processing
