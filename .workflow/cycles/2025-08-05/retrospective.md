# Cycle 1 Retrospective: Quick Note

**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Status**: Completed all 5 priorities âœ“

## What Happened
Successfully completed all priorities - the workflow system now has baseline context through CLAUDE.md and behavioral guidance integrated.

## Key Observation
**Going along with AI suggestions too easily** - Need to be more critical. Several non-existent folders are referenced in CLAUDE.md (`.workflow/ideas/`, `.workflow/decisions/`) that were AI suggestions I accepted without questioning whether we actually want these structures.

## Concerns
- The "Staying on Track" and "Coherence Checking" sections in CLAUDE.md might not actually modify AI behavior enough to be useful
- We'll test this in future cycles to see if it actually helps or just adds noise

## Next Step
Move to Cycle 2 with actual Hexframe development to test if the workflow system helps or hinders real work.
