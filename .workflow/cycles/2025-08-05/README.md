# Cycle 1: Initial Workflow Setup
**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Theme**: System Activation with AI

## Current Milestone

**Milestone 1: Dogfood the workflow system through CLAUDE.md context**

We're dogfooding the workflow system itself. This milestone is about proving that systems can stay alive through actual use. Thanks to CLAUDE.md serving as a comprehensive index, fresh AI sessions automatically know the context and suggest next steps - no commands needed, just pure context-driven guidance.

## Priorities for This Cycle

### 0. Establish baseline context (CLAUDE.md as index)
**Why**: Foundation for everything. Without comprehensive baseline context, the AI constantly needs re-explanation of what Hexframe is, who it's for, and how it works. CLAUDE.md should be the index that points to all key documents (mission, culture, target user, domains, workflow) rather than duplicating information. This enables consistent, informed assistance across all sessions.

### 1. Milestone documentation & issue updates  
**Why**: With CLAUDE.md as the index (from P0), we just need to document milestones properly and update issue commands to use the new structure. Fresh sessions will automatically have context through CLAUDE.md - no complex loading needed.

### 2. Document the 'why' for each priority in .workflow/priorities/
**Why**: Captures decision context once, preventing drift. When we're deep in execution, we need to remember why we chose this path. This helps maintain focus and provides rationale for micro-decisions without constantly re-explaining.

### 3. Create AI prompts to keep user on track (quick implementation)
**Why**: Addresses the system thinker's pitfall - we love tweaking systems more than using them. Need AI to help navigate when to modify workflow vs when to stay on task. Critical for making the workflow actually keep us productive rather than becoming another distraction.

### 4. Create coherence-checking prompts (quick implementation)
**Why**: Hexframe has clear principles (hexagonal relationships, Rule of 6, mission). New features can drift from these principles without realizing it. AI should challenge changes that might break the system's integrity - not to block, but to ensure deliberate decisions.

## Success Criteria

This cycle succeeds if:
- The workflow system has the context it needs to guide effectively
- We can stay focused on tasks without getting lost in meta-work
- The AI helps rather than hinders progress
- We complete these improvements while actually using the workflow

## Meta-Observation

This first cycle is entirely about making the workflow system work better - which perfectly serves our milestone of using the workflow to advance Hexframe. We're building the tool while using the tool.
