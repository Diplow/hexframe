# Priority 2: Document the 'why' for each priority

**Type**: #enhancement #workflow #documentation
**Status**: Planning
**Estimated**: 30 minutes

## Quick Win Implementation

Since this is a quick win and the "why" is already documented in the cycle README, we'll keep it simple:

### Tasks
- [x] Ensure cycle README contains clear "why" for each priority (already done)
- [ ] Update workflow to reference cycle README for rationales
- [ ] Add guidance for future cycles to always document "why"

### Decision
For quick wins like this cycle's priorities 3 & 4, the description in the cycle README is sufficient. No need for separate priority documents unless:
- Complex technical work requiring issue format
- Multi-phase work needing detailed planning
- Work that will span multiple cycles

This priority itself demonstrates the principle - quick win, documented in cycle, no separate file needed.
