# Features Backlog

## Core Features
- **Privacy Controls**: public/private tiles with AI context isolation → [Share] - Control what systems are shared publicly, ensure AI can't access private tiles unless working for owner
- **Group Systems**: Create groups with multiple users, shared ownership of group systems → [Share/Compose] - Enable team collaboration on living systems
- **System Tagging**: ability to tag systems for categorization → [Share] - Enable discovery through tags
- **Tag-based Search**: chat widget to search for systems by tag → [Share] - Find relevant systems to learn from or fork
- **Tile Progress States**: push/release interaction for tiles - visual state change (dimmed/checkmark) to track progress through systems → [Activate] - Track learning/practice/reading progress persistently across sessions
- **AI Integration**: ask for full systems via chat and let the AI generate complete structures → [Create] - Accelerates system creation

## Improvements
- **Naming**: Rename "System" (confusing terminology) → [Create] - Clearer mental model helps creation
- **Chat UX**: rework message UX in chat (current implementation has friction) → [Create/Activate] - Better UX enables both creation and usage

## Missing Core Capabilities
- **System Analytics**: Show usage stats for systems (views, forks, active users) → [Monitor] - Core monitoring capability
- **Activity Tracking**: Track which tiles are most navigated/edited → [Monitor] - Understand system usage patterns

## From Vision Document - Create
- **Web Search Integration**: Search web to import info and format via Hexframe → [Create] - Import external knowledge
- **Voice-to-System**: Convert speech directly into hexagonal systems → [Create] - Faster system creation
- **Domain Templates**: Pre-built templates for specific domains → [Create] - Accelerate specialized system creation
- **Version Control**: Track system evolution over time → [Create] - Enable iterative refinement

## From Vision Document - Share  
- **Forking & Attribution**: Fork systems with proper attribution tracking → [Share] - Build on others' work
- **Comments on Tiles**: Discussion threads on individual tiles → [Share] - Collaborative refinement
- **Fork Trees**: Visualize lineage of ideas through fork relationships → [Share] - Track knowledge evolution
- **Reputation System**: Based on system usage and impact → [Share] - Surface quality systems

## From Vision Document - Compose
- **Drag-and-Drop Composition**: Visual composition of systems (e.g., compose Domain Driven Architect with domain docs) → [Compose] - Intuitive system building
- **Subagents System Decomposition**: Break systems into specialized subagents → [Compose] - Modular architecture
- **System Marketplace**: Browse and integrate community systems → [Compose] - Leverage collective wisdom
- **Compatibility Indicators**: Show which systems work well together → [Compose] - Smart composition
- **AI Composition Suggestions**: AI recommends relevant systems to compose → [Compose] - Intelligent assistance

## From Vision Document - Activate
- **MCP Integration**: Start Claude sessions that auto-call your Hexframe system → [Activate] - AI-powered execution
- **Daily Check-ins**: Guided reviews based on your system → [Activate] - Maintain momentum
- **Calendar Integration**: Connect tiles to calendar and task tools → [Activate] - Bridge planning and doing
- **Context-Aware AI Chat**: Chat that understands your full system → [Activate] - Intelligent assistance
- **Usage Pattern Learning**: AI learns from your patterns and suggests improvements → [Activate] - Adaptive systems

## From Vision Document - Monitor
- **Usage Statistics**: See system usage via chat widget (MCP calls, chat interactions) → [Monitor] - Track engagement
- **Group Analytics**: Track group system usage, member activity patterns, cross-pollination between personal/group systems → [Monitor] - Understand team dynamics and system adoption
- **Fork Statistics**: Track adaptations and success metrics → [Monitor] - Measure impact
- **A/B Testing**: Test different approaches to same goal → [Monitor] - Evidence-based evolution
- **Bias Detection**: Identify systemic biases through usage patterns → [Monitor] - System integrity
