# Milestone 1: Dogfood the Workflow System Through CLAUDE.md Context

## The Goal
Prove that systems can stay alive through actual use, with AI maintaining context across sessions without explicit commands.

## Why This Matters

### The System Thinker's Dream
We've built a workflow system that should guide development. But like all systems created by system thinkers, it risks dying unused. This milestone tests whether we can break that pattern.

### The Innovation: Context-Driven Development
Instead of commands and manual state management, CLAUDE.md serves as a comprehensive index that:
- Tells the AI where we are in the workflow
- Points to current priorities and their rationales
- Enables fresh sessions to pick up exactly where we left off
- Makes the workflow truly alive through constant use

## Success Criteria

1. **Daily Use**: The workflow guides actual Hexframe development every day
2. **Seamless Context**: New sessions immediately know what to work on
3. **No Manual State**: Progress tracked automatically through the system
4. **System Evolution**: The workflow improves through use, not just theory

## What We're Testing

- Can a system stay alive through AI context alone?
- Does CLAUDE.md indexing eliminate friction?
- Will the workflow evolve through practice?
- Can we avoid the system thinker's trap of endless tweaking?

## The Broader Implication

If this works, it proves the Hexframe thesis: System thinkers' creations can finally live through AI that understands their structure. The workflow system becomes the first living proof that systems + AI = sustained practice.

## Next Milestone Preview

Once proven here, we'll transition this workflow into a Hexframe system itself (Milestone 2: Switch to hexframe.ai system via MCP), eating our own dogfood at an even deeper level.
