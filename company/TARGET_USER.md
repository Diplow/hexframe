# Target User: System Thinkers

## Who Are System Thinkers?

System thinkers are people who naturally see patterns, relationships, and structures in the world around them. They can't help but create mental models, frameworks, and methodologies to understand and organize complexity.

## The System Thinker's Journey

### The Gift
- **Pattern Recognition**: They see connections others miss
- **Framework Creation**: They naturally organize chaos into structure  
- **Mental Models**: They build simplified representations of complex realities
- **Process Design**: They imagine better ways of doing things

### The Curse
- **Systems That Die**: They create brilliant frameworks that never get used
- **Over-Engineering**: They perfect the system instead of practicing it
- **Isolation**: Others don't see or care about their elegant structures
- **Theory vs Practice**: Their beautiful models often don't survive contact with reality

## Why They Need Hexframe

System thinkers need their systems to **live** — to be used, tested, evolved through practice. Hexframe solves this by:

1. **Making Systems Tangible**: Visual hexagonal maps make abstract systems concrete
2. **Enabling Activation**: AI agents bring systems to life through daily use
3. **Supporting Evolution**: Systems grow through practice, not just theory
4. **Creating Community**: Share and fork systems with other system thinkers
