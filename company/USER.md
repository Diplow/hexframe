# Me: The Dogfooder

Building Hexframe for myself, using it to build itself.

I was becoming an architecture astronaut - overthinking systems without building. Then AI changed everything. Now I can architect AND build with joy instead of frustration.

This path transformed how I work. I want to share it so others can learn from it.
