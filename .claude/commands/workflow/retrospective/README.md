# Cycle Retrospective Phase

## Purpose
Learn from what happened during the cycle to improve future cycles.

## Duration
1-2 hours of honest reflection.

## Critical Context: Cycle Review

**Before retrospecting, gather data:**
- Review completed tasks vs. planned tasks
- Check `.workflow/current.json` → `progress.execution`
- Compare outcomes to success criteria from Planification
- Assess impact on high-level goal from Goals phase

## Retrospective Framework

### What went well?
- Which tasks were easier than expected?
- What processes worked smoothly?
- Where did the plan accurately predict reality?
- 

### What was challenging?
- Which tasks took longer than estimated?
- What blockers weren't anticipated?
- Where did reality diverge from the plan?
- 

### Key learnings
- Technical insights discovered
- Process improvements identified
- User feedback received
- System understanding evolved
- 

### Process improvements for next cycle
- Planning adjustments needed
- Estimation calibrations
- Communication improvements
- Tool or workflow changes
- 

## Critical Question

**Should we adjust our high-level goals based on what we learned?**

This connects back to the Goals phase - sometimes execution reveals that our fundamental assumptions need updating.

## Impact Assessment

- Did we advance the mission?
- Are systems more likely to stay alive?
- What evidence do we have of progress?

## Backlog Maintenance

**Clean up the backlog based on completed work:**
1. Remove items from `.workflow/backlog/` that were completed in this cycle
2. Add new items discovered during the cycle
3. Update existing items with new context learned
4. Mark partial completions appropriately

This keeps the backlog current and prevents re-selecting already completed work.

## Output
- `retro-{date}.md` with insights and learnings
- Updated `.workflow/backlog/` files with completed items removed
- Updated process notes for next cycle
- Potential goal adjustments to review in next Goals phase

## Next Phase
After retrospective → Either:
- Move to **User Research** if feedback needed
- Return to **Goals** to start new cycle
