# User Research Phase

## Purpose
Understand user needs and validate direction through direct experience and feedback.

## Duration
Variable - may be skipped in early cycles or brief (just using the app yourself).

## Critical Context: Research Focus

**Before researching, consider:**
- What did the retrospective reveal about user assumptions?
- Which priorities need validation?
- What would change our high-level goal?

## Research Methods

### Self-Testing (Minimum)
Using Hexframe yourself to document:
- What felt natural?
- What was confusing?
- What was missing?
- What delighted you?

### Pain Point Documentation
- Specific moments of friction
- Features you reached for that didn't exist
- Workflows that felt cumbersome
- Times the system "died" instead of staying alive

### Feature Discovery
Ideas that emerged during use:
- Natural next steps for the product
- Integrations that would help
- Simplifications possible
- New use cases discovered

### External Validation (When Ready)
- Who else should test this?
- What specific questions to ask?
- Which assumptions are riskiest?
- How to measure system "aliveness"?

## Key Questions

For validating the mission:
1. **Does the system stay alive through use?**
2. **Does AI actually keep you on track?**
3. **Are visions becoming living systems?**

## Output
- `research-{date}.md` with findings
- New priorities for next Prioritization phase
- Validation of current direction
- Potential adjustments to high-level goals

## Next Phase
After research â†’ Return to **Goals** to start new cycle with fresh insights
