# Next Cycle Prioritization Phase

## Purpose
Decide what to focus on in the upcoming cycle based on impact, dependencies, and feasibility.

## Duration
1-2 hours of focused decision-making.

## Critical Context: Current High-Level Goal

**Before prioritizing, review the current goal from the Goals phase:**
- Check `.workflow/current.json` → `progress.goals.core_goal`
- Current goal: "Enable deliberate change by transforming visions into living systems"

Every priority should directly serve this goal. Ask: "How does this help systems stay alive through actual use?"

## Prioritization Framework

Consider each potential priority through these lenses:

- **Impact**: What will most advance your mission?
- **Dependencies**: What unblocks other work?
- **User Need**: What pain points are most urgent?
- **Feasibility**: What can realistically be completed in one cycle?

## Current Candidates

Review and rank these potential priorities:

- [ ] System creation workflow
- [ ] AI system activation
- [ ] System composition features
- [ ] User onboarding flow
- [ ] System monitoring/analytics
- [ ] [Add new candidates based on research/retrospective]

## Selection Criteria

For each candidate, evaluate:
1. How directly does it enable the current high-level goal?
2. What other work does it enable?
3. How many users will benefit immediately?
4. Can we ship something meaningful this cycle?

## Output
Prioritized list of 2-4 objectives for the cycle, documented in the workflow state.

## Next Phase
Once priorities are set → Move to **Planification** to break them down into actionable tasks
