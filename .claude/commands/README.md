# Claude Commands

This directory contains custom commands for Claude Code to enhance development workflows.

## Issue Management Workflow

The issue management system follows a structured three-phase workflow. All commands work with a single document file (`/issues/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug-title>-<issue-number>.md`) that gets progressively completed. Each time a section is added, it's also posted as a comment on the GitHub issue.

### Phase 1: Planning üìã
1. `/issue` - Document the problem from user perspective (required)
2. `/context #<issue>` - Gather codebase context and READMEs (required)
3. `/solution #<issue>` - Document solution approach and strategy (required)
4. `/design #<issue>` - Document UX/UI design principles and visual guidelines (optional but recommended for UI features)
5. `/architecture #<issue>` - Document technical architecture and mental models (optional but recommended)
6. `/tests #<issue>` - Document testing strategy (optional but recommended)

### Phase 2: Implementation üõ†Ô∏è
7. `/implementation #<issue>` - Implement tests first for TDD (optional but recommended)

### Phase 3: Review üìù
8. `/refactor <file_path>` - Refactor for clarity following Rule of 6 (optional)

To be implemented:
9. `/document <branch>` - Update all relevant documentation (required)
10. `/retro #<issue>` - Capture learnings and insights (optional)
